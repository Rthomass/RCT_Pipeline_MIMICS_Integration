# Usage 

This is a set of scripts to follow the rct-pipeline created by ([Wanxin](https://github.com/Rthomass/test/edit/main/README.md)). Its purpose is to:  

i. output a segment level dataset  (trees as rows and tree parameters as coloumns).  
ii. create a parameter dataset suitable for mimics  
iii. set mimics parameters    
iv. run mimics and create a new dataset including all input parameters and radar backscatter reponse.

These scripts utilise the  individual output files provided by the rct-pipeline. The first script creates a csv containing the segment data for all trees in each plot & tile

to run this script it requires first a csv definign appropritate trees - the clouds are not perfect and so require individual assesement. a Reference file containing file quality assessments. This is just a list of tree ids that have been manually checked to determine quality. 



i. a library of output files in the 
Documents/Thesis/mimics/TLS-QSM_results_angola_bicuar_tree/angola_results/rct_extraction/angola_p02_raycloud_-1_0_treesplit/angola_p02_raycloud_-1_0_trees_1_info.txt












## Prerequisites 



## Input Files
matched_stems_picked.csv: 




Tree info files: *_trees_*_info.txt files generated by treeinfo containing segment data
Leaf files: *_leaves.ply files containing 3D mesh data for leaf area calculations
## Explanation
1. This script processes the tree data to create datasets for research. It starts by reading a reference file that identifies which trees are marked as "good" quality. 
2.
3.   then searches through the rct-pipeline directories generated by the treeinfo tool to find matching data. For each good tree, it extracts detailed segment information, calculates leaf area from 3D mesh files when available, and combines all the data into organized CSV files grouped by plot and tile coordinates. The result is a clean dataset that merges tree structural data, segment attributes, and leaf measurements for further analysis.
Input Files



Output
CSV files named angola_{plot_id}_{tile_coords}_combined.csv containing merged tree data for analysis.
