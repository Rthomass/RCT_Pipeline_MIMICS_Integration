This is a set of scripts to follow the rct-pipeline created by ([Wanxin](https://github.com/Rthomass/test/edit/main/README.md)). Using this data this set of scritps creates a set of parameters, inputs the parameters into the mmimics model and runs the mimics model, saving the model output into one comprehensive dataset. 

Its purpose is to:  

# Overview

i. First, output a segment level csv dataset for each tile and plot.  
ii. then using the segment level dataset, create a input parameter dataset suitable for the mimics model
iii. A rapper script then 
iv. run mimics and create a new dataset including all input parameters and radar backscatter reponse.

## Step 1. get_tree_data.py
The first script creates a csv containing the segment data for all trees in each plot & tile. 

To run this ensure the rct-pipeline has been used to produce a directory of tree files describing the structrual attributes of each tree segment of the QSM with  names of that below:

.../rct_extraction/angola_p02_raycloud_-2_1_treesplit/angola_p02_raycloud_-2_1_trees_12_info.txt

Additionally, a reference file containing  quality assessments is required (see matched_stems_picked.csv). This is a list of tree ids that have been manually checked to determine quality. If using your own list ensure you record the height at which the crown starts for later calcualtions. 

## Step 2. create_parameters
This next script transforms raw segment-level tree data (Step 1 Output) into tree-level input parameter sets suitable for the mimics model. 

The min_branch_order and max_branch_order parameters control which trees are included in the analysis and what branch data is calculated for each tree.

min_branch_order (Quality Filter) sets the minimum complexity requirement for trees to be included in the dataset:










The following parameters are calculated using data from the rct-pipeline files
### Branch Probability Density Functions
Within the MIMICS model, the probability density function for any given branch order is determined by selecting the best-fitting function from a predefined library of 15 mathematical functions. These functions range from uniform distributions to various powers of sine functions with different phase shifts, allowing the model to capture diverse branching angle patterns across different tree species and branch hierarchies.

## Input Files
matched_stems_picked.csv: 




Tree info files: *_trees_*_info.txt files generated by treeinfo containing segment data
Leaf files: *_leaves.ply files containing 3D mesh data for leaf area calculations
## Explanation
1. This script processes the tree data to create datasets for research. It starts by reading a reference file that identifies which trees are marked as "good" quality. 
2.
3.   then searches through the rct-pipeline directories generated by the treeinfo tool to find matching data. For each good tree, it extracts detailed segment information, calculates leaf area from 3D mesh files when available, and combines all the data into organized CSV files grouped by plot and tile coordinates. The result is a clean dataset that merges tree structural data, segment attributes, and leaf measurements for further analysis.
Input Files



Output
CSV files named angola_{plot_id}_{tile_coords}_combined.csv containing merged tree data for analysis.
