# Usage 

This is a script to follow the rct-pipeline (Wanxin) designed to output a dataset with all the trees as rows and desiered tree parameters as coloumns. 

## Prerequisites 
## Input Files
matched_stems_picked.csv: Manually created Reference file containing file quality assessments. 
Tree info files: *_trees_*_info.txt files generated by treeinfo containing segment data
Leaf files: *_leaves.ply files containing 3D mesh data for leaf area calculations
## Explanation
1. This script processes the tree data to create datasets for research. It starts by reading a reference file that identifies which trees are marked as "good" quality. 
2.
3.   then searches through the rct-pipeline directories generated by the treeinfo tool to find matching data. For each good tree, it extracts detailed segment information, calculates leaf area from 3D mesh files when available, and combines all the data into organized CSV files grouped by plot and tile coordinates. The result is a clean dataset that merges tree structural data, segment attributes, and leaf measurements for further analysis.
Input Files



Output
CSV files named angola_{plot_id}_{tile_coords}_combined.csv containing merged tree data for analysis.
